## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m **Sarathi**, a data scientist who questions numbers and turns them into stories. My work spans **end-to-end machine learning pipelines**, **spatial analytics**, **interactive dashboards**, and **AI text detection**. From predicting hospital readmissions to mapping flood risk and visualising bird sightings around Melbourne, I enjoy applying data science to real-world problems.

These projects reflect my curiosity across different domains and technologies. I also build things just for fun, like an **F1 analytics dashboard** and a **bird-watching app inspired by a Brooklyn Nine-Nine quote**, small reminders that data can be both practical and playful.

If you’re curious, feel free to ask me about **data science projects**, **customer analytics**, **churn modelling**, **spatial analysis**, or building **end-to-end pipelines and dashboards**. You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarathits), and I’m always happy to chat or collaborate.

### Fun fact
Outside of data, I’m currently training for a **Half Ironman**, and I’m getting an itch to deploy a multi-agent framework to monitor my swimming, cycling, and running.
